# Hamahaki

Created for android course at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. This is my first ever android project.

Hamahaki is a simple web scraper that gets data from a couple of websites. On the last view product links that deliver to a website are given as an intent. 

Websites that were chosen are Finnish retail stores that don't have specific limitations in robots.txt to limit this project.

On the current websites, one of them doesn't work on every search word (generic words like "tv" but works on more specific words (like "playstation 4" or "apple iphone").

With libraries used (Jsoup mainly) this was the best that could be done. Headless javascript engine for dynamic contents could be a solution.
